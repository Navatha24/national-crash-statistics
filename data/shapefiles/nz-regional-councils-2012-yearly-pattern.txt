Description:
  This dataset is the definitive set of regional council boundaries for 2012 as
  defined by the Local Government Commission and/or the territorial authorities
  themselves but maintained by Statistics New Zealand (who are the custodian).
  
  The region is the top tier of local government in New Zealand. There are 16
  regions of New Zealand (Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Local Government Act 2002).
  Eleven are governed by an elected regional council, while five are governed by
  territorial authorities (the second tier of local government) who also perform
  the functions of a regional council and thus are known as unitary authorities.
  These unitary authorities are Auckland Council, Nelson City Council, Gisborne,
  Tasman, and Marlborough District Councils. The Chatham Islands Council also
  perform some of the functions of a regional council, but is not strictly a
  unitary authority. Unitary authorities act as regional councils for the purposes
  of a wide range of Acts and regulations. Regional council areas are based on
  water catchment areas. Regional councils are responsible for the administration
  of many environmental and public transport matters.
