NZTA's Crash Analysis System (CAS)
==================================

An interactive web map of the New Zealand Transport Agency's Crash Analysis System (CAS) data, representing all accidents that have been attended by police, given a location, and that we have chosen to present (based on currency).

[**Take me to the map**](http://www.nearimprov.com/national-crash-statistics)

Made with **Python** (to read the raw CSVs and produce a nice GeoJSON with useful filters and attributes to build the popups) and **Leaflet** (to display the GeoJSON on the map).

[**An early version was featured on the NZ Herald data blog and was the most read article Christmas Day 2014**](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11378832)
